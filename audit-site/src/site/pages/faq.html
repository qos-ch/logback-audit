  <p class="question">
    <a name="audit_undo" href="#audit_undo">Can audit operations be
    undone?</a>
  </p>
  
  <div class="answer">
    <p>In the current implementation of logback-audit, it is
    <em>not</em> possible to undo an audit operation.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- ============================================= -->
  <p class="question">
    <a name="before_or_after" href="#before_or_after">
      Should auditing be performed before
      or after a business operation, i.e. the operation being audited,
      is performed?
    </a>
  </p>
  
  <div class="answer">
    
    <p>Suppose in a method foo adds a user to a database. The question
    is whether the auditing operation should be done before or after the
    call to <code>addUser()</code>.
    </p>
    
    <p>The choice is between</p>
    <p class="source">public void foo(String userName) {
  addUser(userName);
  audit(...);
}</p>
  
   <p>and </p>
   <p class="source">public void foo(String userName) {
  audit(...);
  addUser(userName);
}</p>

  <p>If the first variant is chosen and the call to addUser() fails
  with an exception, then the <code>audit(...)</code> call will be
  skipped. However, if the <code>addUser()</code> succeeds but the
  <code>audit(...)</code> call fails with an exception, then the audit
  database will be missing an entry.
  </p>

  <p>If the second variant is chosen and the call to
  <code>audit(...)</code> fails with an exception, then the
  <code>addUser(...)</code> call will be skipped. However, if the
  <code>audit()</code> succeeds but the <code>addUser(...)</code> call
  fails with an exception, then the audit database will contain a
  superflous entry for an operation which did not complete.</p>

  <p>In practice, auditing operations fail only if the audit server or
  the database are not available, which are relatively rare
  occurances. Thus, compared to an audit operation failure, there may
  be many more reasons why a business operation might fail.
  </p>

  <p>It follows that under most circumtances, it is better to perform
  an operation first and only after it succeeds to audit it.
  </p>

  <p class="question">
    <a name="same_transaction" href="#same_transaction">Can a business operation and its
    auditing be performed in the same transaction?</a>
  </p>
  
  <div class="answer">
    
    <p>Given that at present time audit operations cannot be undone,
    it is not possible to have a businees operation and its audit
    operation be in the same transaction.
    </p>

    <p>Assuming you perform a business operation fist and its audit
    second, if you require transactional behaviour, you can attempt
    undo the business operation in case the audit operation fails.
    Here is an example:
    </p> 

    <p class="source">public void foo(String userName) { 
  addUser(userName); 
  try { 
    audit(...); 
  } catch(AuditException e) {
    removeUser(userName);
  }
}</p>
